## Component

Use this code in INI section to inject JS player into current page/partial/layout.

```ini
[lottie]
```

When it's done, you can use Lottie player as many times as you want with different values of **url** property.

Next example code will generate two animations following one-by-one:

```twig
{% component 'lottie' url='https://example.com/path/to/file1.json' %}

{% component 'lottie' url='https://example.com/path/to/file2.json' %}
```
